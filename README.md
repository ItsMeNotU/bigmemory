bigmemory
=========
My fork of the bigmemory package.  Please be aware, this is not a stable
repository and constantly in develop.  Please refer to the master copy of
[bigmemory](https://github.com/kaneplusplus/bigmemory).


### Wish List
1. big.data.frame functionality
2. direct access to a RDBMS (Oracle, Postgresql, etc.)
3. Additional big.matrix subclasses (e.g. sparse, positive-definite, etc.)
